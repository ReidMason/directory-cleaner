# Directory cleaner

A simple rust script that recurses through directories and deletes any directories that match the provided format.\
This is designed for cleaning up large code directories when archiving projects such as removing the "node_modules" directory from Javascript projects.

## Todo

- Command line parsing
- Regex support
- Unit tests
- Support removing files as well as directories
